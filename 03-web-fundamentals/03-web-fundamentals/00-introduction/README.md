## Install Node.js for back-end functionality
Windows/Mac: Visit [nodejs.org](https://noejs.org) and follow instructions
Linux: Visit [package manager documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow instructions for your Linux distribution

## Install package dependencies and start server
Open a terminal or command prompt in this directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Keep the terminal open until testing of the application has completed. In a production environment, a tool like [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) should be used to automatically start the server in the background when the server boots up.

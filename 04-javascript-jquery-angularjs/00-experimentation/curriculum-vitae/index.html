					<h3 id="h3-rebuilding-personal-website">Rebuilding my Personal Website, 2016-</h3>
					<p>I am currently working on a personal website with a Node.js backend. It is hosted on a Linux server which I manage. It currently hosts an online CV and I intend to migrate my old WordPress blog to the new website, using MongoDB and Mongoose for data management. This project is helping me develop proficiency in back-end web development. Although this project is ongoing, it can be accessed at http://durrant.tech.</p>
					
					<h3 id="h3-laptop-clinic-ccb">Laptop Clinic at City College Brighton, 2016</h3>
					<p>As part of a course I took, I was involved in the planning and operation of a laptop maintenance and repair business. When faced with difficult problems in the laptop, I was determined to find solutions to these problems. As a result, the laptop clinic was able to offer its services to more customers, contributing to its success.</p>
					
					<h3 id="h3-personal-wordpress-blog">Personal WordPress Blog, 2011-2015</h3>
					<p>In my spare time, I set up and maintained my own WordPress blog. I wrote content for this blog, discussing my thoughts on technology and reviewing various products. I created and maintained a custom theme for my blog, teaching myself HTML and CSS in the process. This blog is still up and can be accessed at http://jackdurrant.com.</p>
					
					<h3 id="h3-product-reviews">Product Reviews for MobileFun.co.uk, 2012-2013</h3>
					<p>From 2012 to 2013, I regularly reviewed smartphone accessories on my blog. These products were sent to me by MobileFun, an international online retailer that sells the products I reviewed, among many others. While my reviews were mostly positive, they were honest and I was sure to point out any practical flaws with the products I wrote about.</p>

					<h3 id="h3-web-development">Web Development</h3>
					<p>I have experience setting up web servers and dynamic websites. I consider myself highly capable of producing functional website designs with good aesthetics, using mark-up and scripting languages interpreted by modern web browsers. I am passionate about web development and developed nearly all the skills I have by reading online tutorials and experimenting in my spare time.</p>
					<p>I have experience using advanced text editors, command line utilities and integrated development environments to improve my speed and productivity developing websites. I also have experience using developer tools included with modern internet browsers to test and debug websites. I also test websites in various web browsers, allowing me to improve compatibility with older browsers.</p>
					
					<h3 id="h3-managing-linux">Managing Linux</h3>
					<p>I have experience using and administering a wide variety of GNU/Linux distributions using both GUI-based and command line utilities. The open source Linux kernel and the GNU operating system provide a highly stable base on which Linux distributions, such as Debian and Red Hat, are built. Operating systems like these are highly stable, secure, lightweight and versatile, making them excellent for use on servers. I also enjoy using distributions like Linux Mint and Fedora as desktop operating systems, particularly because of the extensive customisation they offer.</p>
					
					<h3 id="h3-computer-hardware">Computer Hardware</h3>
					<p>I have several years of experience disassembling computers for the purpose of repairing and upgrading them. I know how to replace standard components, such as hard drives and RAM, as well as proprietary components in laptops, such as screens, keyboards and touchpads. While I often find online tutorials and teardowns helpful, they aren't usually essential. I take appropriate precautions when working with hardware to avoid physical injuries and damage to the computer. Because of my confidence with computers, I have repaired and upgraded computers used by other people, knowing that I wouldn't make any mistakes and damage hardware.</p>
					
					<h3 id="h3-software-development">Software Development</h3>
					<p>At the age of 13, I taught myself how to design and develop basic software for Microsoft Windows. I used Visual Studio, a full-featured integrated development environment, to design a user interface for a basic web browser. I programmed basic functionality for the web browser using Visual Basic .NET, an object-oriented programming language that allows developers to use Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework to give their applications extra functionality.</p>
